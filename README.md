# PixelGrapher
A little program the graphs lines, on pixels!

A library built with python and pygame, with a very small learning curve.

Right now you can only graph lines, but you can make them move too!
Lines are mapped to pixels that are drawn as circles to the screen using pygame.

Customizeable Resolution and Framerate to make cool animations.

Several colors are default in the library to add some creativity to animations.

You can use several premade animation variables, like bounce or counter, or make your own.
